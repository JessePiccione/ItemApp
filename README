This project requires Java 17 or higher to run the application
Github Codespaces by default is currently using java 11 
To edit this project on github codespaces still you will need to update to Java 17 minimum 

Run the following commands in the shell to update to java 17: 
    
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk
    export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64
    export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH


Great Java 17 is installed! Now you can run the project.

If you reload Codespaces the Bash terminal will revert back to Java 11 
run the following command in order to set the utilized java version to 17

    export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64
    export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH

This should allow the proccess without attempting to reinstall java 17
